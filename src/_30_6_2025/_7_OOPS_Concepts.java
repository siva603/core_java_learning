	 * 
	 * Encapsulation : 
	 * -------------------------------------------------------
	 * 
	 * 1. the process of binding data members and function members within single unit
	 * is called as Encapsulation.
	 * 
	 * 2. mainly Encapsulation is used for Data hiding
	 * Data hiding is nothing restrict the direct access data and providing indirect 
	 * access through setter and getter methods.
	 * 
	 * setter methods are used set the hiding data.
	 * getter methods are used get the hiding data.
	 * 
	 * 3. we can achieve Encapsulation by using class 
	 * because we can write data(variables) and functions within the class only.
	 * 
	 * Inheritance
	 * ----------------------------------------
	 * 1. the process aquiring properties and behaviors from parent class to child class.
	 * is known as inheritance.
	 * 
	 * it is mainly used for code reusability.
	 * 
	 * we can achieve inheritance by using extends keyword
	 * 
	 * types of inheritance :
