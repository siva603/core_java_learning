	/*
	 * OOPS stands for object oriented programming language.
	 * java is object oriented programming language.
	 * it is provide a mechanism to convert real word entity(person, bottle, bag...) to object entity.
	 * 
	 * object oriented programming is nothing we can write programs by using class and object
	 * 					or
	 * In oops we write programs by using class and object
	 * 
	 * --------------------------------------------------------
	 * 
	 * 
	 * class : 
	 * ------
	 * 	it is blueprint of object.
	 * 	it is keyword.
	 *  it is logical entity
	 * 	it is mainly used for 2 purpose
	 * 
	 * 		1. to execute the program
	 * 		2. to create the blueprint for object
	 * 
	 * 				syntax : for create class
	 * 
	 * 				class ClassName{
	 * 
	 * 						// block of code 
	 * 				}
	 * 
	 * object : 
	 * --------
	 * 
	 * it is instance of class
	 * it is physical entity
	 * object is a real word entity 
	 * which has properties(non-static variables ) and behaviors (non - static methods)
	 * 
	 * 		examples for properties(variables):				examples for behaviors(methods)
	 * 
	 * 				name, age, gender				sleep, eat, walking, talking
	 * 
	 * for a class we can create no of objects 
	 * because we can write properties and behaviors only within the class.
	 * 
	 * 				syntax : to create object for class
	 * 
	 * 						ClassName ReferenceVariableName = new ClassName();
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Constructor:  --> ClassName();, new --> keyword
	 * -------------
	 * it is special non static method 
	 * it is used to create object and initialize object properties with defalut values;
