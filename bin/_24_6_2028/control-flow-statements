Control flow statements
----------------------------------
control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution

types of control flow statements
-----------------------------

1. conditional statements
-------------------------

based on condition we control the flow of execution

--> based on conditions if we want execute statements then use if else 

--> based on value if we want execute statements then use switch statements

	1. simple if condition( it is used  when we have only one conditions)
	
			if(condition){ // relational operators
			
				// block of code will execute if condition becomes true
			}
			
	2. if - else condition(it is used  when we have only two conditions only)

			if(condition){
				// block of code
			}
			else{
				// block of code
				it will execute if conditions becomes false
			}
			
	3. if - else if - else
		condition(it is used when we have  more than two conditions )

			if(condition){
				// block of code
			}
			else if(condition){
				// block of code
			}
			else if(condition){
				// block of code
			}
			else{
				// block of code
				it will execute when all conditions become false
			}

	4. switch : 
	
	switch is used when we have to execute block of code based on values.
	
	syntax :
	
		switch(val){
		
			case val1 : {
				block of code
				break;
			}
			
			case val2 : {
				block of code
				break;
			}
			
			.....
			
			default : {
			// when all cases fails it will execute
			}
			
		}
	
========================================================================

2. loops statements	-> this loops statements are when we want to execute multiple times
=--------------------------

		1. while -> this is used when we want execute block of code mulitple times
		
			it will check 1st condition after execute. execution continue until
			condition become false.
			
			while(condition){
			
				// block of code;
				
				-> increament / decreament;
			}
		
		2. do-while -> this is used when we want execute block of code multiple 
		times. 
		1st it will execute block of code one time after it will check 
		condition if condition is true execution will continue other wise stop
		
			do{
			
				block of code;
				
			} while(condition);
			
			

		3. for -> this is used when we want execute block of code multiple times
		and we can write all conditions in single line
		
		1st -> initialization will execute only one time
		2nd -> condition will check true or false
		3rd -> block of code will execute if condition is true
		4th -> increment or decrement will execute
		
		for(initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement){
		
			block of code
			
		}
